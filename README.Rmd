The goal of IDAlearnR is to publish interactive tutorials for the module **"Introduction to Data Analytics with R"**.

## Installation

You can install IDAlearnR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edwardgunning/IDAlearnR")
```
## Interactive tutorials

### Launching from the Tutorials pane

Once you have installed the package, you should be able to launch the tutorials from the "Tutorial" pane on the right-hand side of the RStudio IDE (provided that you have a recent version of RStudio installed).

Press "Start Tutorial" and once it has loaded in the pane, press the ![](inst/figures/open-in-browser.png) button to open the tutorial in an internet browser.

Otherwise, you can launch them using the `run_tutorial()` function from the `learnr` package.

### Launching using `run_tutorial()`

#### Tutorial 1 - The basics of R

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial(name = "section_1_basics_of_R",
                     package = "IDAlearnR")
```

#### Tutorial 2 - Lists, loops and functions

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial(name = "section_2_lists_loops_functions",
                     package = "IDAlearnR")
```
