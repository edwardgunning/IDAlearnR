# preparing for lists

```

## Lists

### Introducing lists

In the last tutorial, we learned that a vector in R can only contain elements of the same class. 

In contrast, **lists** are a versatile structure that can contain objects of _different classes_ as elements. The elements of a list can be of any class --- character strings, numeric vectors, matrices, and even other lists! 

### Creating lists

The `list()` function can be used to create a list in R. If no arguments are passed, then the list is empty. Each argument that is passed to a list becomes an element of the list, which can be either named or unnamed. The elements of lists are often named for easier access.

### 

**Exercise**: 

The following code creates a named list with elements which are numeric vectors of the same length. Modify the code to:

1. Store vectors of different lengths in `my_list()`.

2. Store vectors of different classes and different lengths in `my_list()`.

Use descriptive names for the elements.

```{r list1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 20}
# Creating a named list with the following vectors as elements
# create vectors:
v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 
v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)

# create list containing vectors
my_list <- list(first_element = v1, second_element = v2) # create list

my_list
```

```{r list1-hint}
# Part 1: Two vectors of different lengths. 
v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33, 55, 66) # length 6 
v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 2) # length 4

my_list <- list(longer = v1, shorter = v2) 

my_list
```

```{r list1-solution}
# Part 2 Two vectors of different classes and lengths. 
# Long character vector:
v1 <- c("Hello", "how", "are", "you", "today", "?")
# Short numeric vector
v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)

my_list <- list(longer_char= v1, shorter_num = v2) 

my_list
```

### Subsetting Lists

Similarly to indexing vectors, you can use brackets (`[]`) to access elements of a list, which will _always_ return a list. You can use double brackets (`[[]]`) or `$name` to return an element of a list, but the class of the object returned is the class of the object 
stored in that position (which often will not always be a list).

###

__Exercise__:

- Run and manipulate the following code to become familiar with subsetting lists.

```{r list-2-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}
l <- list(first_element = c(1, 5, -11, 33),
          second_element = c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)) 

# Access first_element with single brackets: this returns a list.
preserved <- l["first_element"]   
preserved
class(preserved)
```

```{r list-2-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}
l <- list(first_element = c(1, 5, -11, 33),
          second_element = c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)) 

# Access first_element with double brackets: this returns the vector stored. In this case a numeric vector
simplified <- l[["first_element"]] 
simplified
class(simplified)
```

```{r list-2-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 9}
l <- list(first_element = c(1, 5, -11, 33),
          second_element = c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)) 

# Some Alternatives:
l # print the full list to screen
l[1] # equivalent to preserved (by index)
l[[1]]  #  equivalent to simplified (by index)
l$first_element # equivalent to simplified
```

__Note__: 

- Subsetting using `[]` is called __preserving__ because it preserves the class of the object (it still returns a list). Subsetting using `[[]]` is called __simplifying__, it returns the simplest class of object possible, which in this case is the class of the object stored in the list.

### Appending lists

You can add elements to a list simply by referencing the position or name that you want the object to be saved at in the list. The following code demonstrates how elements can be added to a list.

```{r, echo = T}
# Create list:
l <- list(first_element = c(1, 5, -11, 33) , second_element =  c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)) 

# Add by position
l[[3]] <- c(22, 23) # adds a vector as element 3 in l.

# Add by Name: 
l$Something <- "A thing"  # Appends an list element - "A thing", named "Something" - to the end of the list

# Print list
l
```

###

__Note__: It printed `[[3]]` instead of `$name` for the third element because we did not use a name to append it.

### Element names

The function `names()` can be used to find the names of list elements.

```{r, echo = T}
names(l)
```

### 

Assigning values to elements to the vector that `names()` returns allows us to add or change names.

```{r, echo = T}
# let's name third element
names(l)[3] <- "third_element"

l
```

### Making a connection - data frames and lists

In the last tutorial, we said that data frames were lists containing vectors of the same length, used to store tabular data. That is why we can use `$name` subsetting to access a column of a data frame --- underneath the hood, we are just accessing the element of a list!

We can also use `[[]]` subsetting to access columns of a data frame.


## If-else statements

###

`if`-`else` statements are very common and will be familiar to those with experience in almost any programming language. They allow you to test a condition and act on it depending on whether it’s true or false.

### `if` statements

To start, we will introduce an `if` statement.

```r
if(<condition>) {
  # do something
}
# continue with rest of code
```

The `<condition>` here will be a logical statement (revise this section in Tutorial 1 if you are unsure). If the statement returns `TRUE`, the code within the `{}` will be executed. Otherwise, nothing will happen.

###

__Exercise:__

The following code generates a number between 0 and 10 and assigns it to `rand_num` (note: we haven't set the random seed so this will be different each time you run it). Add to the code so that the string `"Greater than 5"` is printed if the number is greater than 5, and nothing happens otherwise. Run your solution multiple times and observe different results.

```{r ifel, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
rand_num <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 10)
```

```{r ifel-solution}
rand_num <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 10)

rand_num # check out what the number is

if(rand_num > 5) {
  print("Greater than 5")
}
```

### `else` statements

The above code does nothing if the condition is false. If you have an action you want to execute when the condition is false, then you need an `else` clause. The general structure is as follows.

```r
if(<condition>) {
  # do something
} else {
  #do something else
}
```

###

__Exercise__:

Add an `else` statement to the previous exercise's solution to print the string `"Less than or equal to 5"` if the number is not greater than 5.

```{r ifel2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
rand_num <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 10)

rand_num # check out what the number is

if(rand_num > 5) {
  print("Greater than 5")
}
```


```{r ifel2-solution}
rand_num <- runif(n = 1, min = 0, max = 10)

rand_num # check out what the number is

if(rand_num > 5) {
  print("Greater than 5")
} else {
  print("Less than or equal to 5")
}
```

## Loops

### Introducing loops

Loops are used in programming when you need to do the same thing to multiple inputs: repeating the same operation on different columns, or on different datasets. Loops are used less frequently in R than in other languages (it is common to write functions, which we will come across next, to extract repeated tasks and remove the need for duplicate code) but many R users will use loops from time to time. 

In this section, we will learn about __for loops__.

### Basic structure of `for` loops

`for` loops in R have the following structure.

```r
for(iterator_variable in some_vector) { # sequence

  do_something_to(iterator variable) # body
  
}
```

`for` loops take an iterator variable --- we usually use `i` to abbreviate iterator, but any letter, or valid object name can be used --- and assign it successive values from some vector (often, this vector is a sequence of integers used `for` indexing, but not always).

###

__Example__: Print the numbers between 1 and 10.

```{r, echo = T}
for(i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```

Of course, we could also define the vector `1:10` beforehand and use it in the same way.

```{r, echo = T}
iter_seq <- 1:10
for(i in iter_seq) {
  print(i)
}
```


### Iterating

Now, suppose we have the character vector `c("a", "b", "c", "d")`.

```{r, echo = T}
char_vec <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
```

We could print each element in a number of ways:

###

#### 1. Define a sequence of integers for indexing manually

Generate the sequence `1:4` for indexing manually, because we know that `char_vec` has four elements. The `char_vec[i]` gives the i<sup>th</sup> element of `char_vec`.

```{r, echo = T}
for(i in 1:4) { # sequence
  print(char_vec[i]) # body
}
```

###

#### 2. Use `seq_along` to automatically generate a sequence of integers for indexing 

First, let's see what `seq_along()` does.

```{r, echo = T}
seq_along(char_vec)
```

It creates a sequence of integers for indexing `char_vec`. We can iterate through this sequence, indexing `char_vec` in the exact same way as before.

```{r, echo = T}
for(i in seq_along(char_vec)) {
  print(char_vec[i])
}
```

###

__Tip__: Although `1:length(char_vec)` will achieve the same thing as `seq_along(char_vec)` in most cases, `seq_along()` is regarded as safer because it handles vectors of length 0 differently. 

###

#### 3. Iterate through `char_vec` itself, instead of indexing

```{r, echo = T}
for(i in char_vec) {
  print(i)
}
```

### 

This might seem like the easiest way to construct the loop, however, we often we want to store a result in another vector, and looping through indexes is useful for iterating through both the input and output. Furthermore, we can only iterate through a vector, so when we want to loop through elements of a list, we must use indexing.

###

__Exercise__: 

We have created a list in the background called `num_list`, containing numeric vectors of different lengths. Write a `for` loop to print the mean of each element.

```{r}
set.seed(1) # ensures the random numbers are the same each time this is drawn.
num_list <- list() # create empty list and we will then fill elements
num_list[[1]] <- rnorm(n = 10) # generate 10 numbers randomly from a normal distribution
num_list[[2]] <- rnorm(n = 20) # generate 20 numbers randomly from a normal distribution
num_list[[3]] <- c(1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) # create a shorter vector
num_list[[4]] <- seq(from = 1, to = 25, by = 1) # a sequence from 1 to 25
```

```{r looplist, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 8}
str(num_list) # look at structure of list
```

```{r looplist-hint}
# Partial Solution:

for(i in seq_along(num_list)) {
  # do something
}
```


```{r looplist-solution}
# Full Solution:

for(i in seq_along(num_list)) {
  print(mean(num_list[[i]]))
}
```



### Storing outputs

So far, we have just printed values within the `for` loop. However, we will usually perform some calculation, and need to store the output. It is good practice to create an object in which to store the output _before_ the `for` loop.

###

For example, suppose we have a data frame with four numeric columns:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Generate a data set
set.seed(1) # ensures the random numbers are the same each time this is drawn.
num_df <- data.frame(var1 = rnorm(n = 10),
                     var2 = rnorm(n = 10),
                     var3 = rnorm(n = 10),
                     var4 = rnorm(n = 10))
```

If we wanted to calculate and store the standard deviation of each column using a loop, we would first need to create a vector to store the four standard deviations.

__Note__: Vectors can be created quickly using the `vector()` function. We indicated that it would be numeric, by specifying `mode = "numeric"` and chose it to be of length 4 to store the standard deviation for each of the four columns (the length of our output vector should be the same as the length of the sequence we iterate through).

```{r, echo = TRUE}
output_store <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = length(num_df)) # 1. output

for(i in seq_along(num_df)) { # 2. sequence
  
  output_store[i] <- sd(num_df[[i]]) # 3. body
}
```

###

We can then call the vector `output_store` to view our output.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
output_store
```

###

To summarise, when we want to store our output, our basic `for` loop structure has three steps:

1. **Output:** Set up an object to store the output of the loop.

2. **Sequence:** Define an iterator variable and a vector to iterate through.

3. **Body:** This is the code that does the work. It is run repeatedly, each time with a different value for the iterator variable.

###

__Exercise__: 

Modify the loop that you wrote above to __store__ instead __print__ the mean of each vector in `num_list` (remember, we have stored `num_list` in the background for you). Then, print your stored output. Check that this vector contains the numbers you printed earlier.

```{r outputloop, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 12}
# Previous solution:
for(i in seq_along(num_list)) {
  print(mean(num_list[[i]]))
}
```

```{r outputloop-solution}
mean_store <- vector(mode = "numeric",
                     length = length(num_list)) #1. output

for(i in seq_along(num_list)) { # 2. sequence
  
  mean_store[i] <- mean(num_list[[i]]) # 3. body
  
}

# print our result
mean_store
```

### 

__Exercise__:

Write a `for` loop to find the __number of unique values__ in each column of the `mtcars` data set.

```{r mtcarsunique, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 12}
# 
```

```{r mtcarsunique-hint-1}
# unique gives the unique values of a vector
x1 <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)
unique(x1)
# ... now think about how we would get the NUMBER of unique values
```

```{r mtcarsunique-hint-2}
# unique gives the unique values of a vector
x1 <- c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)
unique(x1)
# Then the NUMBER of unique values is the length of the vector of unique values
length(unique(x1))
# Now, Think about the output, sequence, and body for writing the loop.
```


```{r mtcarsunique-solution}
unique_store <- vector(mode = "numeric",
                       length = length(mtcars)) # 1. output 

for(i in seq_along(mtcars)) { # 2. sequence
  
  unique_store[i] <- length(unique(mtcars[, i])) # 3. body
  
}

# print stored output
unique_store
```

### 

There are also `while` and `repeat` loops in R, but we will not cover them in this course. Additionally, the `lapply` function allows you to loop through elements of a list and apply a function to them without writing a loop.

## Functions

###

> A functional style means decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces, then solving each piece with a function or combination of functions.
>
> --- Wickham, H., (2019)

###

So far, we have used many of the built in functions in R such as `c()`, `mean()`, `seq()` and `plot()`. In this section we will explore functions in more depth. You will learn how to write your own functions, which will eventually allow you to automate common tasks and solve specific problems in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting. 


[This section](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) of R for Data Science describes the advantages of the functional style.

### Functions in R

- Functions in R are objects and are treated similarly to other objects (e.g., vectors). They can be passed as arguments to other functions and even defined within other functions.

- Watch this [short video](https://vimeo.com/220490105) about functions in R from Rstudio.

### Basic structure of a function

Defining a function in R consists of defining main things: a _name_, _arguments_ and a _body_. 

###

#### Name

Let's first create a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing. Here, we are only concerned with defining and naming the function.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
do_nothing <- function() {
  # empty body
}
```

This is an assignment statement for creating an object (using `<-`) like we have already seen. We have chosen a descriptive name for our object - it tells the user what the function does. The function object is created by the `function()` command.

Function objects have their own class.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
class(do_nothing)
```


Let's execute the function by typing the object name followed by `()`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
do_nothing()
```

As expected, it does nothing!

###

#### Body

Now, suppose we want the function to do some computation, we place some code in the __body__, within the `{}`, after `function()`. This code is run each time we call our function object. For now, we will just make our function print a sentence to the screen.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print_something <- function() {
  print("I have written a function!")
}
```

Now, let's call our function again:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print_something()
```

### 

#### Arguments

__Arguments__ are the options that you can specify to the user that the user may explicity set. For this basic function, we can add an argument that determines how many times "I have written a function!" is printed to the console.

```{r, echo = T}
print_something_n_times <- function(n){
  for(i in 1:n){
    print("I have written a function!")
  }
}
```

Then, when we (as the user) call the function, we must specify `n`. Suppose we want to print the sentence to the screen 4 times.

```{r,echo = TRUE}
print_something_n_times(n = 4)
```

###

If we tried to call our function without specifying `n`, we would get an error.

```{r, error = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
print_something_n_times()
```

### 

We can, however, set default argument values when writing our function, by typing `= <value>` after the argument name. The argument in our function will take this value unless otherwise specified.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print_something_n_times <- function(n = 2){
  for(i in 1:n){
    print("I have written a function!")
  }
}
```

Now, if `print_something_n_times()` is called, but `n` is not specified, it will print our sentence twice (because we have specificied `n = 2`).


```{r, echo = TRUE}
print_something_n_times()
```


### Return statments

Now, this function does not return any object, it just prints our sentence to the screen. Say, we wish to return the number of characters that are printed to the the screen in total (excluding the quotation marks) to be stored and used later.

(this is just the number of character in "I have written a function!" times the number of times it is printed)

note: the number of characters in a string can be obtained using the `nchar()` function.

```{r, echo = T}
print_sentence_return_n_char <- function(n = 2){
  for(i in 1:n){
    print("I have written a function!")
  }
  
  num_of_char <- nchar("I have written a function!")
   
  num_of_char * n # return this number
}
```

R returns the **last expression** that is evaluated within the function body, which in this case is `num_of_char * n`. There `return()` function can be used to select what is returned, but its use is reserved for special cases.

```{r, echo = T}
print_sentence_return_n_char(n = 1)
```

And, we can store the value it returns using an assignment statement.

```{r, echo = T}
num_of_chars_1 <- print_sentence_return_n_char(n = 1)
```

```{r, echo = T}
num_of_chars_1
```

This object (the number 26) is now stored in out R environment, and can be used again. For example, we can perform arithmetic operations on it:

```{r, echo = T}
num_of_chars_1 * 2
```

### Quiz question 

```{r functions-quiz}
quiz(caption = "",
  question("For the function defined above, what value would running `print_sentence_return_n_char()` **return**?",
    answer("An error! We have not specified any arguments."),
    answer("`NA` (missing value)"),
    answer("`52`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`26`"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct. The default value for the argument `n` is set to 2, so in this case, because we have not specified `n`, the function returns 2 times the number of characters in \"I have written a function!\" (which we know from above is 26): 2 × 26 = 52.",
    incorrect = "Incorrect! Check whether a **default** value for `n` was specified when we defined the function."
  ))
```

### Exercises


#### Exercise 1

Write a function that returns the square of a number. Call it, `sq_num()`.

```{r sqnm, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
# type solution here
```


```{r sqnm-solution}
# full solution
sq_num <- function(x){
  x^2
}
```

###

#### Exercise 2

In mathematics, the "L-2 norm" of an n-dimensional vector $(x_1, \dots, x_n)^T$ is given by

$$
||x||_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + .... + x_n^2} .
$$
Write a function called `l2_norm` that calculates and returns the L-2 norm of an n-dimensional vector in R. 

Verify your calculation by testing the function on some known examples (e.g., the vectors $(3, 4)^T$ and $(2, 3, 6)^T$ - the answers should be 5 and 7, respectively).

```{r L2norm, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 12}

```

```{r L2norm-hint-1}
# Partial solution to function
l2_norm <- function(vec) {
  
  sum_part <- sum(vec ^ 2) # sum of each element squared
  
  # now need to return square root of sum part...
}

```


```{r L2norm-hint-2}
# Full solution without tests
l2_norm <- function(vec) {
  
  sum_part <- sum(vec ^ 2) # sum of each element squared
  
  sqrt(sum_part)
}

```

```{r L2norm-solution}
# Full solution with tests

# Function
l2_norm <- function(vec) {
  
  sum_part <- sum(vec ^ 2) # sum of each element squared
  
  sqrt(sum_part)
}

# Test:
test_vec1 <- c(3, 4)
l2_norm(vec = test_vec1)

test_vec2 <- c(2, 3, 6)
l2_norm(vec = test_vec2)
```


**Note:** We did not have to use a loop to square each element in the vector, simply writing `vec^2` squared each element because the operation is vectorised.



###

#### Exercise 3

Building on Exercise 2, the general "L-p norm" of an n-dimensional vector $(x_1, \dots, x_n)^T$ is given by

$$
||x||_p = (|x_1|^p + .... + |x_n|^p)^{1/p}.
$$

Write a function called `lp_norm` that calculates the L-p norm of any vector in R, given a value of p.


Verify your calculation by calculating the L-2 norm of $(3, 4)^T$ and $(2, 3, 6)^T$ (again) and the L-1 norm of $(1, 2, -2)^T$ - the answer should also be 5.

**Hint:** Don't start afresh, modify the code from exercise 2.

**Extra:** If you wish, you can set the default value of $p$ as 2, so that the function returns the L-2 norm by default


```{r Lpnorm, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 15}

```


```{r Lpnorm-hint-1}
# Function, no test

lp_norm <- function(vec, p = 2) {
  
  # get the absolute value of each element of vector
  abs_vec <- abs(vec)
  
  # sum of each element to power of p
  sum_part <- sum(abs_vec ^ p) 
  
  # return sum part ^ 1/p
  (sum_part)^(1/p)
}
```

```{r Lpnorm-solution}
# Function, with tests

# note: setting default value of p = 2
lp_norm <- function(vec, p = 2) {
  
  # get the absolute value of each element of vector
  abs_vec <- abs(vec)
  
  # sum of each element to power of p
  sum_part <- sum(abs_vec ^ p) 
  
  # return sum part ^ 1/p
  (sum_part)^(1/p)
}

# Tests of L2 norm
test_vec1 <- c(3, 4)
lp_norm(vec = test_vec1)

test_vec2 <- c(2, 3, 6)
lp_norm(vec = test_vec2)

# test of L1 norm
test_vec3 <- c(1, 2, -2)
lp_norm(vec = test_vec3, p = 1)
```



## Function Arguments

###

You have learned how to write your own functions in R. However, you will often use functions that someone else has written, and it's important to know how to specify arguments for them. This interactive quiz will test your knowledge and familiarize you with function arguments.

### Quiz

#### Set up
We will work with the `rnorm()` function which generates random draws from a normal distribution. 

```{r, echo = T}
# get structure:
str(rnorm) 
```

We can see that it has the three arguments:

1. `n` - the number of observations/ draws.

2. `mean` - the mean of the distribution for each draw. While this can be a vector the of length `n` (a different mean for each draw), for now we'll just specify it as a single number (the same mean for each draw).

3. `sd` - the standard deviation of the distribution for each draw. Again, we will just specify a single number.

The argument `n` has no default, but `mean` and `sd` have dafaults of 0 and 1 respecively. We should note the order of the function arguments.

#### Questions

```{r testarguments, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
# use this box to test your answers

# you can use set.seed(1) before each random draw 
# if you want to set the state of the random number generator


```

```{r testarguments-solution}
# 1)
set.seed(1)
rnorm(n = 1)

set.seed(1)
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)


# 2)
set.seed(1)
rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 2)

set.seed(1)
rnorm(1, 0, 2)

# 3)
rnorm(sd = 2, mean = 0, n = 1)

# 4) 
set.seed(1)
rnorm(sd = 2, 5, 3)
set.seed(1)
rnorm(n = 5, mean = 3, sd = 2)
```

```{r arguments-quiz}
quiz(caption = "",
  question("Are the following commands equivalent? \n \n`rnorm(n = 1)` and \n`rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 1)`?",
    answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct. When we don't specify `mean` and `sd` in `rnorm(n = 1)`, they take on the default values of 0 and 1, respectively.",
    incorrect = "Incorrect, try again."
  ),
  question("Are the following commands equivalent? \n \n`rnorm(1, 0, 2)` and `rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 2)`",
    answer("Yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct. When we don't specify argument names, R assigns them the values we supply in order.",
    incorrect = "Incorrect, try again."
  ),
  question("Will the folllowing throw an error? \n \n `rnorm(sd = 2, mean = 0, n = 1)`",
    answer("Yes, the argument names are in the wrong order"),
    answer("No", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct. We can specify arguments by name in any order we like. The above command is identical to `rnorm(n = 1, mean = 0, sd = 2)`.",
    incorrect = "Incorrect, try again."
  ),
  question("The command `rnorm(sd = 2, 5, 3)` is equivalent to which of the following? ",
    answer("`rnorm(n = 3, mean = 5, sd = 2)`"),
    answer("`rnorm(n = 5, mean = 3, sd = 2)`", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct. When we specify one argument by name and others without, the named argument is 'taken out' and the others are evaluated in order In this case, 5 is assigned to `n` and 3 to `mean`.",
    incorrect = "Incorrect, try again."
  )
  )
```

## Packages

###

> "An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R."
>
>--- Wickham & Grolemund, (2016)


### Base R

So far, you have have used functions in R that were installed when you downloaded R from the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN). This is called the *base R system*. Base packages contain low-level, fundamental functions that allow R to work and perform standard statistical and graphical methods (e.g., `mean()`, `sum()`, `plot()`...). 

Run the following command to see the base packages that are automatically loaded in your R session.

```{r base, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
sessionInfo()$basePkgs
```


### Extending the functionality of base R

Base R's capabilities are extended through user-created packages, which add specific functionality to R. They include reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.

CRAN hosts R packages for download. At the time of writing, there are over [18,000 R packages available for download from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/). All packages on CRAN must consistently meet standards/ a certain level of quality and they are routinely tested. 

Packages from CRAN can be installed with just a single command 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = F}
install.packages("package_name")
```

Then to load them into R, so that you can use their functionality, you can just type the following:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = F}
library("package_name")
# or
library(package_name)
```

Package documentation and help can be found by either of the following commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
help(package = "package_name")
# or
package?package_name
```

### The `tidyverse` packages

Now that we have mastered the basics of R programming, our attention will turn to using R for *data analysis*. For this, we turn to the **Tidyverse**, a collection of R packages designed to make data science faster and easier.

The tidyverse is contains packages that contain functions for dealing with common data science tasks, including data import and export, wrangling and cleaning, transformation and visualisation. All packages in the tidyverse share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

To install the tidyverse, run the following command in your RStudio console:

```{r insttidy, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then,  to load the tidyverse and make it available in your current R session, run:

```{r libtidy, echo = TRUE, eval = F}
library(tidyverse)
```
