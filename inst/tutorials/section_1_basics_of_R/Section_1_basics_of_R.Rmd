```

## Assigning values to variables

###

- You can create new objects and assign values by typing `<-`.
- All R statements where you create objects, called __assignment__ statements, have the same form:

```{r, assigment-example-1, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
object_name <- value

object_name # print object_name to screen by run the name of the object


```

###

We will start by creating an object and assigning it a numeric value. Try the following:

- Create a variable `x` and store the number `3` in it, then print `x`.
- After you have stored `3` in `x`, store `5` in `x`, and print `x` again.

```{r assignment-1, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r assignment-1-hint}
# partial solution
x <- 3 # create a variable x and store 3 in it
x

# now, try the second part of the exercise
```

```{r assignment-1-solution}
x <- 3 # create a varaible x and store 3 in it
x

x <- 5 # this will overwrite the value stored in x and place a 5 in there
x
```

###

You could also use `=` to assign values to variables. Why use `<-` instead of `=`:

- `=` is usually reserved for function arguments.
- `<-` more explicitly shows that variable assignment is being carried out (particularly when `=` is reserved for another purpose).

- [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) (Chief Scientist at RStudio & creator of the [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/)) recommends against using `=` instead of `<-` in the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html#coding-basics) with [Garrett Grolemund](https://www.rstudio.com/speakers/garrett-grolemund/), and also in the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#assignment-1).

- The majority of the help you find online, on StackOverflow for example, will use `<-`.

<!--- - For historical reasons: the computers that `R` was developed on actually had a `<-` button. --->

- If you prefer to use `=` , be aware that there are some strange edge cases that you could be unlucky enough to come across (although I've rarely, if ever, encountered a problem).

Later, when you begin to use RStudio IDE, you can use the keyboard shortcut for `<-`: 

* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> on Windows.
* <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> on Mac.


### 

Use the following quiz to to test your knowledge and learn more about assignment statements.

```{r quiz-prac-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
# if you are unsure, or want to test your answer, you can type code in here




```


```{r quiz-prac-1-solution}
# copy-paste and run the code for each question separately.
# modify the code if you need to know more.

# Q1
x <- 1
x + 3

# Q2
x <- 'first value'
X <- 'Does this overwrite x?'
print(x) # well... does it? 

# Q3 
x = 5 # just mixing `=` and `<-` to make the point that they do the same thing.
y <- 6 + 2 * x
y

# Q4
3 -> z
z

# use of statements like 3 -> z is not very conventional,
# even though it is possible, we will not use it in this course.

# pro tip for funky looking code
x <- 3 -> y
# seriously though, this is nice to be able to do but someone else reading your code will get a headache from doing this kind of stuff too much...

x <- y <- 3 # this is quite handy and is much more readable

```

    )
)
```


## Vectors
###
__Vectors__ are one-dimensional arrays which are fundamental for programming in R. In this section, we will learn about the basic types of vectors, and how they can be created and used.


### Creating vectors

The `c()` function (read __combine__ for `c`) is used to combine multiple values to make a __vector__.

For example, the command `c(1, 2, 3, 4)` combines the numbers `1` to `4` in a vector of type __numeric__.

### 

Using the `c()` function create the following vectors:

- `v1` containing numbers `1`, `5`, `-11`, and `33`.
- `v2` containing strings `"Hello"`, and `"world"`.
- `v3` containing logical `TRUE`, `TRUE`, and `FALSE`.

```{r vectors-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r vectors-1-hint}
v1 <- c(1, 5)       # Combines the numbers 1 and 5 in a Numeric vector
v1
# modify it to include  -11 and 33 also.
```

```{r vectors-1-solution}
v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33)       # Combines Numeric vector, length 4
v1

v2 <- c("hello","world")    # Character vector, length 2 (a vector of strings)
v2

v3 <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)  # Logical vector, same as c(T, T, F)
v3
```

### Vector length
The __length__ of a vector is the number of values (called __elements__) it contains. The `length()` function returns the length of a vector. For example, we can create a vector with __3__ elements, 8, 9 and 10, and check its length.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
my_vec <- c(8, 9, 10) 
length(my_vec)
```

### Vector types
R defines different basic vector __types__ based on the values they contain. The most important types of vector are _logical_, _integer_, _double_, and _character_. Later, we will learn about more data structures that are built on top of these basic types.

Watch [this short video](https://vimeo.com/220490316) by RStudio Education to familiarise yourself with these four types.

###

In summary:

- If the values are numbers, R recognises a vector as __numeric__. R will store the numbers in [double-precision floating-point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format), so you will see __numeric__ vectors referred to as being type __double__. E.g., `c(1.1, -2, 3)`.

- If the values are strings, surrounded by quotation marks, R recognises a vector as a __character__. E.g., `c("hello", "goodbye")`.

- __integer__ vectors contain integer values, followed by a capital L. E.g., `c(1L, 2L, 4L)`.

- __logical__ vectors contain `TRUE` and `FALSE` (and `NA`) values. E.g., `c(TRUE, FALSE)`.

We will explore these variable types, and their extensions, in more depth soon. 

We can use the `typeof()` function to find the basic type of a vector.

```{r, echo = T}
logical_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
typeof(logical_vec)
```

####

Find out the type of `v1`, `v2` and `v3`. 

```{r vectors-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r vectors-2-solution}
typeof(v1)

typeof(v2)

typeof(v3)
```

### Combining vectors

One of the very few basic rules in R is that vectors must contain objects of the same type.Therefore, you can use `c()` to combine multiple vectors into a single vector, but this comes with a health warning. If you are not careful, it may result in __type conversions__. Type conversion (also refered to as __typecasting__) refers to changing an entity of one datatype into another, which R can automatically do when we combine two vectors of different types.

### 
- Use the `c()` function to combine `v4` and `v5` and save in a new variable called `v6.`
- Check the type of `v6.`

```{r vectors-3, exercise = TRUE}
v4 <- c(1,2,3)
v5 <- 'This is a string'
```

```{r vectors-3-solution}
v4 <- c(1,2,3)
v5 <- 'This is a string'
v6 <- c(v4 , v5)
typeof(v6)
```

### 
To create the vector `v6`, R automatically converted the elements of `v4` to character.


### Subsetting vectors

#### Index subsetting

Often, we are only interested in specific values in a vector.

- You can access a specific element of a vector by its index using the brackets operator (`[]`). For example, `v6[4]`, will return the fourth element of `v6`: `'This is a string'` (you can try this in the exercise box above).

- You can index multiple elements by supplying a vector of values that you wish to index a vector by. To index the first and last (fourth) value of `v6` we can use the following `v6[c(1, 4)]`, which will return a (sub-)vector: `"1" "This is a string"`. 

We will deal with indexing in more detail later.

#### Subsetting named vectors

You can also have __named__ vectors where each entry takes a specific name. This can be useful for indexing (extracting) specific values from a vector without having to reference the position of the desired elements in the vector.

```{r assignment-4, exercise=TRUE}

v2 <- c(first_word = "hello", second_word = "world")
print(v2)

v2["first_word"] # you can access values by names using square brackets
# more on this later
```


## Sequences
###
You will often have to create a vector containing a sequence of numbers. For example, you might need to generate ID numbers for a data set. There are many ways to generate a sequence in R. We will illustrate two methods in this section. 

### 
Create a vector `v` that contains the numbers `1` to `7` via the following:

- Using the `:` which will create a sequence (`x:y` will generate a sequence from `x` to `y` with a spacing of `1` unit between values).

- Using the `seq()` function. R has an extensive help function, run `?seq` to look up the documentation of how to use the `seq`. In particular, look to the arguments section to see what values you should pass to the `seq()` function.

```{r sequences-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r sequences-1-hint-1}
# partial solution
v <- 1:7         # same as c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  
v

# examine help file for seq function
?seq
```

```{r sequences-1-solution}
# full solution
v <- 1:7         # same as c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  
v

v <- seq(from = 1, to = 7, by = 1)  
v
```

###
We used the `from = 1` argument to define the first term in the sequence, `to = 7` to define the final term and `by = 1` to define the increment (or step).

Instead of specifying the increment using the `by` argument, we could instead specify the __number of terms__ in the sequence using the `length.out` argument. 

### 

- Use `seq()`, again specifying the `by` argument, to generate a sequence from `-10`, to `10`, where the sequence increases in steps of `2`. Call it `v_by`.

- Calculate and store the length of the vector `v_by`.

- Now that you know the length of `v_by`, create the same sequence using `seq()`, but specify `length.out` instead of `by`. Call it `v_out` and compare it to `v_by`.

```{r sequences-2, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r sequences-2-hint}
# partial solution
v_by <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 2) # create sequence using by to specify step size
v_by 

length_v_by <- length(v_by) # store the length of the vector
length_v_by

# ... now, need to to create the same sequence but using the length.out argument instead of by
# hint: `from` and `to` arguments stay the same
```

```{r sequences-2-solution}
# full solution
v_by <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 2) # create sequence using by to specify step size
v_by

length_v_by <- length(v_by) # store the length of the vector
length_v_by

v_out <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, length.out = length_v_by) # creating a new sequence, specifying the length

# compare output:
v_by
v_out
```


### Extra: Replication

Another function that can be useful is the `rep` (short for replicate). Examine the help file to see how the `rep` function operates and answer the following:

- create a vector that contains the string `"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"` 10 times.
- create a vector that contains the sequence `1:3` where the sequence is repeated 2 __times__.
- create a vector that contains the sequence `1:3` where __each__ element is repeated 3 times.

```{r sequences-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<div id="sequences-3-hint">
**Hint:** For the second and third parts of the exercise, you will need to specify either the `times` or `each` arguments. Can you guess which argument each task requires?
</div>

```{r sequences-3-solution}
v <- rep("All work and no play makes Jacks a dull boy", 10)  
v

v <- rep(1:3, times=2) 
v

v <- rep(1:3, each=2) 
v
```

## Vector operations

###
You can use the normal mathematical operations between vectors. The typical arithmetic operators are catered for:

- `+` (addition),
- `-` (subtraction),
- `*` (multiplication),
- `/` (division),
- `^` (powers). 

### Operations on vectors of the same length

Operations between vectors are performed element-wise. When vectors are of the same length, this is straightforward to understand. Investigate this in the following exercise.

1. Add `op_v1` and `op_v2` together. Make sure you are happy that each element in `op_v1` was added to the corresponding element in `op_v2`.

2. Divide `op_v1` by `op_v2` and note the output.

```{r operation-1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
op_v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 
op_v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 0)
```

```{r operation-1-solution}
op_v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 
op_v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 0)

# 1
op_v1 + op_v2

# 2
op_v1/ op_v2
```

###
__Note__: The fourth element of `op_v1/ op_v2` returns `Inf`, because we are dividing the last element of `op_v1` by 0.

### Operations on vectors of different lengths

Now, what happens if we add vectors of different lengths? 

The simplest case would be to perform an operation on a single numeric value (which is really just a vector of length 1) and a longer vector. 

Complete the following exercises and, based on the results, answer the quiz questions:

1. Subtract the value `1` from `op_v1`.

2. Add the vector `c(1, 2)` to `op_v2`.

```{r operation-2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
op_v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 
op_v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 0)
```

```{r operation-2-solution}
op_v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 
op_v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 0)

# 1
op_v1 - 1 # subtract 1 from op_v1

# 2
c(1, 2) + op_v2 # add c(1, 2) to op_v2
```


```{r operation-2-quiz}
quiz(caption = "",
    question('Q1: What happened when you subtracted 1 from `op_v1`?',
    answer('The value 1 was subtracted from the __first__ element of `op_v1`'),
    answer('The value 1 was subtracted from the __last__ element of `op_v1`.'),
    answer('The value 1 was subtracted from __each__ element of `op_v1`.', correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct! The numeric value is subtracted from __each__ element. <br> We can think of this as R creating a vector of length 4 with each element being the value 1, and subtracting this vector from `op_v1` elementwise."
    ),
  question('Q2: When you added `c(1, 2)` to `op_v2` what happened?',
    answer('An Error because I was adding a vector of length 2 to a vector of length 4.'),
    answer('The first two elements of `op_v1` had `c(1, 7)` added to them element wise.'),
    answer('The shorter vector was replicated up to the same length as `op_v1` and then added together element wise.', correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    correct = "Correct! This is something we need to be _very_ careful of. <br> Even though the vectors are of different length, R will not give an error message. It will recycle the shorter vector, replicating it up to the same length as the longer vector and then perform element-wise operations.<br> When the smaller vector's length is a multiple of the length of the bigger vector (like in this case), R will not even give a warning! <br> If you are skeptical, check that the following give the same result: <br> `c(1, 2) + op_v2` <br> `c(1, 2, 1, 2) + op_v2` <br> `rep(c(1, 2), times = 2) + op_v2` "
    )
)
```

###

Also, all of the common arithmetic functions are available:

- `sqrt()` ($\sqrt{}$), 
- `min()` (minimum),
- `max()`(maximum),
- and many, many more...

Functions such as `sqrt()`, which take a vector and operate on the entire vector are called __vectorised functions__. 

```{r vectorised example, echo = T}
squares <- c(1, 4, 9, 16) # vector of first 4 square numbers
sqrt(squares) # apply sqrt to entire vector
```

### A word of caution

In addition to working with vectors of different lengths, we must also be very careful with the __order of operations__! 

Remember, from earlier, that R will follow the __BODMAS__ (**B**rackets, **O**rders (powers/roots), **D**ivision, **M**ultiplication, **A**ddition, **S**ubtraction) rule for the order in which it will carry out calculations. Don't be afraid to use brackets to make the order of operation explicit. 

For example, if we wanted to scale (divide) the vector `v1` by `range` (`max` - `min` of `v1`), one might write the following code, but upon inspection, the answer is not right. Correct it.  

```{r operation-4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 7}
opp_v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 

opp_v1 / max(opp_v1) - min(opp_v1)

# we should have returned: 0.02272727  0.11363636 -0.25000000  0.75000000
```

```{r operation-4-solution}
opp_v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 

opp_v1 / (max(opp_v1) - min(opp_v1)) # ahhh that much more like it...

# we should have returned: 0.02272727  0.11363636 -0.25000000  0.75000000
```


## Variable types

###
We have already been introduced to the basic types of vectors in R. Built on top of these are some other **_classes_** of objects which will also be important for our data analysis.

###
In the data sets we will analyse, the variables we encounter will typically belong to one of the following classes:  

|class     |description                                                         |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------    |
|numeric   |Numeric data (approximations of the decimal numbers, -12.321, 0.1,34.7 etc) |
|integer   |Integer data (whole numbers, -1,1231, -9765)                       |
|factor (unordered)   |Categorical data (simple classifications, like sex)             |
|factor (ordered)   |Ordinal data (ordered classifications, like educational level)     |
|character |Character data (strings)                                           |
|logical   | `True` and `False`                                                |

###
The `class()` function returns the class of an object. 

```{r basic class, echo = T}
num_vec <- c(1, 2, 3)
class(num_vec)

char_vec <- c("hello", "how are you?")
class(char_vec)

truth_vec <- c(FALSE, TRUE, T, F)
class(truth_vec)
```

###
__Note:__ `T` and `F` are identical `TRUE` and `FALSE` in R. In this module, we prefer to use `TRUE` and `FALSE` for clarity.

### Factors

We have encountered many of the classes in the above table already as basic vector types. However one important class of object in R which we are yet to learn about are __factors__.

__Factors__ are designed to represent categorical data that can take a fixed set of possible values. 

### Why do we need factors?

Imagine that we have data that records answers to a survey question, where the possible responses are "yes", "no" and "maybe". Given what we have learned so far we would probably record the data as a character vector.

```{r, echo = T}
char1 <- c("yes", "no", "yes", "maybe")
```
###
However, using a character vector to store this data has two problems.

1. There are only three possible responses, but nothing saving you from typos.

```{r, echo = T}
char2 <- char2 <- c("yes", "no", "yes", "naybe") # intentional typo
```

2. It only sorts alphabetically, which might not be the most useful way (maybe we would want it to be sorted in the order "no", "maybe", "yes")

```{r, echo = T}
sort(char1)
```
###
Both of these problems are fixed by using a factor variable. 

To create the factor variable, we must create a vector containing the valid __levels__, in the order we want them to be sorted.

```{r, echo = T}
answer_levels <- c("no", "maybe", "yes")
```

And then use the `factor()` function, with the first argument being the vector of data, and the second taking the levels we have specified.

```{r, echo = T}
fac1 <- factor(char1, levels = answer_levels)
class(fac1)
fac1
```

###
Because we have specified the distinct values that our factor is allowed to take, any values not in this set (such as our intentional typo) will be silently converted to `NA`.

```{r, echo = T}
fac2 <- factor(char2, levels = answer_levels)
fac2
```

Our factor now sorts in the order we have specified.

```{r, echo = T}
sort(fac1)
```

### Ordered factors
Sometimes the levels of a factor variable have a natural ordering that we want R to recognise. We call these ordinal data, and record them as an __ordered factor__.

Consider data from a Likert scale.

```{r, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/likert-scale.jpg")
```

Let's create some fake data.

```{r, echo = T}
likert_data <- c("Very Satisfied", "Very Unsatisfied", "Neutral", "Very Unsatisfied","Satisfied")  
```

And a vector of valid levels.

```{r, echo = T}
likert_levels <- c("Very Unsatisfied", "Unsatisfied", "Neutral", "Satisfied", "Very Satisfied")
```

We can create an __ordered factor__ in two ways:

1. Using `factor()` and setting `ordered = TRUE`.

```{r, echo = T}
likert_ordered <- factor(likert_data, levels = likert_levels, ordered = T)
likert_ordered
```

2. Using `ordered()`.

```{r, echo = T}
likert_ordered <- ordered(likert_data, levels = likert_levels)
likert_ordered
```

When printing the levels, R shows that they have a definite ordering using the `<` symbol. Other than this, you will not notice any other differences from an unordered factor at first, but it can become important later when running statistical models.

### Type testing and converting

You can easily test if a vector is of a certain type or convert a vector using the following functions: 

|test         |conversion   |
|:------------|:------------|
|is.numeric   |as.numeric   |
|is.logical   |as.logical   |
|is.integer   |as.integer   |
|is.factor    |as.factor    |
|is.character |as.character |
|is.ordered   |as.ordered   |

Given the following vector `x`: 

- Test if `x` is a numeric variable.
- Convert `x` to numeric and save the results in variable `y`.
- Examine `y` and answer the quiz questions.

```{r var-type-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
x <- c("7", "7*", "7.0", "7,0")
```

```{r var-type-2-solution}
x <- c("7", "7*", "7.0", "7,0")

is.numeric(x)

y <- as.numeric(x); y


is.numeric(y)
```


```{r var-type-3-quiz}
quiz(
  question("Q1: Is `x` numeric?",
    answer('Yes'),
    answer('No', correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Q2: What is the class of `x`?",
    answer("logical"),
    answer("integer"),
    answer("factor"),
    answer('ordinal'),

    answer('character', correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE

    answer('NaN'),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question('Q4: what does the warning message when converting `x` to numeric mean?',
    answer('R does not know how to convert some values of `x`', correct = TRUE),

  )
)
```

## Special values

Like most programming languages, `R` has several special values that are exceptions to the normal variable types described in the previous section. These are `NA`, `NaN`, `NULL` and `±Inf`. 

### `NA`

- Stands for __not available__.
- `NA` is a placeholder for a missing value. 
- All basic operations in R handle `NA` without crashing and mostly return `NA` as an answer whenever one of the input arguments is `NA`.
- The function `is.na()` can be used to detect `NA` variables.

### `NaN`

- `NaN` stands for __not a number__. 
- This is generally the result of a calculation whose result is unknown or undefined mathematically, but it is surely not a number. In particular, operations like `0/0`, `Inf-Inf` and `Inf/Inf` returns an `NaN`.
- Computations involving numbers and NaN always result in NaN.
- The function `is.nan()` can be used to detect `NaN`'s.

### `NULL`

- `NULL` is similar to the empty set from mathematics.
- `NULL` is special since it has no class (its class is `NULL`) and has length `0`, so it does not take up any space in a vector.
- The function `is.null()` can be used to detect NULL variables.

### `Inf`

- Stands for _infinity_ and only applies to vectors of class numeric.
- A vector of class integer can never be `Inf`.
- `Inf` is a valid numeric that results from calculations like division of a number by zero. 
- Since `Inf` is numeric, operations between `Inf` and a finite numeric are well-defined, and comparison operators work as expected.
- the exception is `0/0` which results in `NaN` since it is not defined.

  ),
  question('Q2: Running `sum(c(NA, 1, 2))` results in an `NA`; what argument from the function `sum` can help the computation run as expected?',
    answer('`na.retain = FALSE`'),
    answer('`na.rm = TRUE`', correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

    answer("`NA`"),
    answer("`NULL`"),
    answer("`7`", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("Q5: What is the result of `Inf == Inf`? Note: that “==” asks the question “are these quantities equal?”. More logical operations are on the way",
    answer("`TRUE`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`NA`"),
    answer("`NULL`"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Q6: What is the result of `log(-10)`?",
    answer("`TRUE`"),
    answer("`NA`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`NULL`"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Logical operations

We can use the standard operators to compare different data structures (vectors, matrices, data.frames, tibbles, etc.):

- `==` (equality),
- `!=` (inequality, the `!` is read as "is not"),
- `<` (less than), 
- `>` (greater than),
- `<=` (less than or equal to), 
- `>=` (greater than or equal to). 

These operations return boolean values (which we have seen before): `TRUE` or `FALSE` (often abbreviated to just `T` and `F`).

The `!` operation can be used in front of any boolean value to return the opposite boolean logical. For example:

- `!TRUE` returns `FALSE.`
- `!(x == 5)` return all value of x that are __not__ equal to 5 as `TRUE`.
- `!is.na(x)` returns all values of x that are not missing. 

```{r logical-op-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
x <- c(10,5,5,122)

x == 5 # checks which values of x are equal to 5

x != 5 # checks which values of x are not equal to 5

# or
!(x == 5)

```


The `|` and `&` operators work on boolean values:

- `|` is the OR operator (e.g. `x | y` will return `TRUE` if either `x` OR `y` are `TRUE`).
- `&` is the AND operator (e.g. `x & y` will return `TRUE` if both `x` AND `y` are `TRUE`).

When dealing with a boolean vector, say `x` the following functions are useful:

- `any(x)` will return `TRUE` if __any__ of the values of the vector are `TRUE`.
- `all()` will return `TRUE` if __all__ of the values of the vector are `TRUE`.

Additionally, the `%in%` operator identifies the values from one vector which are present in another.

```{r logical-op-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
x <- c(1,2,3,11) # if we wanted to see which values of x

y <- c(-10:10) # are in y

x %in% y # we get TRUE for any values of x that are in y and FALSE for if they are not present.

```

Given the vectors `v1` and `v2` run the following comparisons: 

- Test if `v1` is greater than `2`.
- Test `v1` and `v2` for equality (you should return values for each element).
- Test for values of `v1` that are greater than `2` __OR__ values of `v2` that are less than `-3.`
- Test which values of `v1` are in the vector `c(1:10)`

```{r logical-op-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33)
v2 <- c(1, 5.0, -11, 2)
```


```{r logical-op-3-solution}
v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33)
v2 <- c(1, 5.0, -11, 2)

v1 > 2       # Each element is compared to 2, returns logical vector

v1==v2       # Are corresponding elements equivalent, returns logical vector.

v1!=v2       # Are corresponding elements *not* equivalent? Same as !(v1==v2)

(v1 > 2) | (v2 < -3)   # | is the boolean OR, returns a vector.

v1 %in% c(1:10)

```

## Indexing

In R, specific values of a vector are accessed by indexing using brackets `[]`. For example, `v[1]` will select the first value from the vector `v`. Note that this means that `R` indexes values starting from `1` rather than `0` (unlike `Python` or `C`).

Whatever you put inside the brackets, tells R which values of the vector object you want. There are two main ways that you can use indexing to access subsets of data in a vector: numerical and logical indexing.

There are two indexing types: numerical and logical. Numerical indexing accesses elements by their position, whereas logical indexing does it using logical statements. Logical indexing is very powerful when combined with the logical operations from the last section. It is also possible to use __negative indexing__. When a negative number is used to index a vector, all values __except__ for the value in that position are returned.

```{r index-0, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 14}
v <- c(1, 5, -11, 33)

v[c(1,3)] # returns the first and third values of v using numerical indexing

v[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)] # does the same as above but with a logical vector

log_index <- v < 4 # create a logical index, where it is TRUE if it is less than 4 and FALSE otherwise
v[log_index] # use the logical index to find the values of interest

v[-c(2,4)] # All other values that are not in position 2 and 4 will be returned

```


Use __indexing__ (`[]`) to select:

- The third value from `v`.
- The second to the fourth values from `v`.
- The first and third values from `v` using a vector of numbers and a vector of booleans.
- All values in `v` greater than `3` using a logical statement.

```{r index-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
v <- c(1, 5, -11, 33)

```


```{r index-1-solution}
v <- c(1, 5, -11, 33)

v[3]             # third element of v1

v[2:4]           # elements 2, 3, 4 of v1

v[c(1,3)]        # elements 1 and 3 - note that your indexes are a vector

v[c(T,F,T,F)]  # elements 1 and 2 - only the ones that are TRUE

v[v>3]     
```


```{r index-2-quiz}
quiz(
  question("Q1: The third value from `v`? (Multiple correct answers)",
    answer("`v[3]`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`v[-3]`"),
    answer("`v[c(3)]`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`v[c(2)]`"),
    answer("`v[2]`"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Q2: The second to the fourth values from `v`? (Multiple correct answers)",
    answer("`v[2,3,4]`"),

    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

    allow_retry = TRUE

    answer("`v[v>4]`", correct = TRUE),
    answer("`v[v == 5 | v == 33]`",correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Lists, briefly

Lists are a versatile structure that allows for the storage of any data structure. A single list can contain all kinds of elements --- character strings, numeric vectors, matrices, other lists, and so on. The elements of lists are often named for easier access.

The `list()` function can be used to create a list in R. If no arguments are passed the list be empty. Each argument that is passed to a list become an element of the list, which can be either named or unnamed.

```{r list-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
v1 <- c(1, 5, -11, 33) 
v2 <- c(5, 1.2, -11, 2)

l <- list() # create an emtpy list

# create a list with the following elements
l <- list(first_element = v1, second_element = v2) 

l
```

Similarly to indexing vectors, you can use brakets (`[]`) to access elements of a list, which will always return a list. You can use double brackets (`[[]]`) to return a component of a list, but it will always return the original vector type that was stored in that position. Accessing list elements:

```{r list-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
l["first_element"]   # Access first_element with single brackets: this returns a list.

l[["first_element"]] # Access first_element with double brackets: this returns the vector stored. In this case a numeric vector.

l # print the full list to screen

l[[1]]     # Returns the first component of the list, equivalent to above.
```

You can add elements to a list similply by referencing the position that you want the vector to be saved at in the list. Adding more elements to a list:

```{r list-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
l[[1]] <- NULL # add an element to the empty list l

l # note that the vector in position 1 is removed and replaced by the entry 'second_element'

l[[3]] <- c(22, 23) # adds a vector as element 3 in the empty list l.
# given that there is nothing in the second position the second position will be `NULL`

l$Something <- "A thing"  # Appends an list element - "A thing", named "Something" - to the end of the list
```


The function `names()` can be used to find the names of list elements.

## Data frames

The data frame is a special kind of list used for storing dataset tables. Think of rows as cases, columns as variables. Each column is a vector, where the vectors may contain different variable types (e.g., numeric, logical, factor).

Creating a dataframe:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# create a data frame
your_first_df <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:4, # create a varaible (column) called ID
  name = c("Stephen","Aoife","Pete","Sarah"), 
  female = c(F,T,F,T), # add logical for 'female' varaible
  age=c(22,33,44,55), # create a age varaible
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE # other wise all 'strings' will be treated as factors
  )
```

### Indexing data frames

Indexing data frames is similar to vectors or lists. As data frames are two dimensional, you have to specify the __rows__ and __columns__ of interest, again, using square brackets. For example `your_first_df[rows_of_interest, cols_of_interest]`. As columns are names vectors, you can also specify via the variable name as well. Some examples are given below:

- To obtain the first row, all columns

```{r df-1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
your_first_df[1,] # return the first row  

your_first_df[3,] # return the third row
```

- To obtain the first column, all rows

```{r df-2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
your_first_df[, 1] 

```

- To obtain the age column, all rows

```{r df-3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}
your_first_df[,'age']
# OR....
your_first_df$age 
# OR...
your_frist_df[, 4] # as the 4th column corresponds to age
```

- To obtain the rows 1 and 2, columns 3 and 4 - the female and age

```{r df-4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
your_first_df[1:2,3:4]
your_first_df[1:2,c('female', 'age')]
```

- To obtain the rows 1 and 3, all columns

```{r df-5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}
your_first_df[c(1,3),]
```

How would you obtain all rows with age greater than 30?

```{r df-6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

```

```{r df-6-solution}
your_first_df[your_first_df$age>30, ]

```
